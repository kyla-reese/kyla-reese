# The creative with a computer 🫶


Hi there! 👋  
<br>
I'm Kyla Reese Dela Cruz. I'm a graduate of De La Salle University, Manila with a degree in BS Computer Science, Major in Software Technology. At the end of my stay, I was able to get a 3.3 CGPA, granting me the "Honorable Mention" status. 

Overall, I'd describe myself as a motivated and diligent computer scientist in the making. I've consistently been on the dean's list for most of my college career and I'm knowledgeable in Web, App, and Java development. I've also had experience with E2E and automation testing. Aside from these coding capabilities, I also have organization, communication, and interpersonal skills that help me present code analysis and create documentation with ease!

## Specialization
I mostly specialize in **💻 Java and Web Development**. 
<br> But I also have experience in **👾 UI and Game Design** and I've done **📋 Quality Assurance** work too! 

*Throughout my four year stay in college, we learned moreso "how to learn" rather than focusing on one specific aspect to master. Because of this I've gained experience in many differnt this. I've done mobile development, machine learning, game development, and I've also become able to learn new langauges rather quickly. Despite this, however, I've really found myself attracted to Java and Web Dev in particular. As such, that's where I've decided to hone my skills.*

## Hobbies
*Aside from coding and design, I also have a plethora of other hobbies that I like to spend my time on. Most of my ideas, in terms of design, color schemes, coding project concepts, etc. tend to stem from my want to solve a problem or fill a need that I've found while dabbling in these past times.* 

- I like to bake. 🍪
- I crochet things for myself and friends. 🧶
- I'm well read. 📖 
- And I like cozy games! 🎮
